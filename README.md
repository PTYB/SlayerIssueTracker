# PTY Slayer Tracker 

## Read me before proceeding
*Constant disregard may/will involve you losing access*

This script is very much beta, do not report bugs/suggestions/question in my dms but on the issue tracker. Please provide information in bug reports [here](https://github.com/PTYB/SlayerIssueTracker/issues). I will attempt to sort them as best as possible although there is no promises as I am very busy in real life.

## Current status/What am I working on 
I have created a board [here](https://github.com/users/PTYB/projects/2) which will let you know what I am currently working on.

I will attempt to track what I am working on and what is planned. Feel free to create enhancement requests in the issues tab although if they aren't realistic I realistically won't be working on them.
